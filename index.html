<h3>Work Project Details Summary</h3>
	<p>
	I worked in an ATT project in which  my role is in application testing support. Role was to build lab environments as well as production environments for testing purpose for every release that would occur at interval of 3-4 weeks. Along with this we would perform kit installations, work on deployment codes and migration issues related to applications. The main objective of the project was to maintain a smooth environment for the testers to perform their tests. <br><br>
	The other ATT project I worked was for an API Platform which supports the smooth functioning of about 150+ APIs of AT&T. The Platform is used for deployment of rich APIs. There is a provision for ATT developers as well as other developers to onboard their applications ontoBlackFlag platform for smooth experience.<br>
	My role in team was as an Application/Production Support. The role was to ensure smooth functioning and uptime of all environments especially prod environments on which API traffic hits continuously.
